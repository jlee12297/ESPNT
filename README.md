# ESPNT

Project Summary:
  ESPN'T is a database project that functions as a fully up to date data grabber. Our motivation to build this project was to create a fully functional sports database that is easy to navigate. Most sports statistics websites are very cluttered and hard to for a user to navigate due to the clutter. Our goal with ESPN'T was to make it not only easily navigable, but also to make the page itself look nice. We did that by adding a carousel full of high resolution action shots of athletes. Throughout this project we all learned how to better work with third-party API's, as well as strengthening our current skills with CSS, Javascript, and HTML. We also learned how to work collaboratively. 

How to use:
  To use ESPN'T, you pick a sport on the main page and it will then take you to a new page where the user will type in an athletes name and press enter. The user will then be taken to a new page where the athlete's stats will be displayed!
